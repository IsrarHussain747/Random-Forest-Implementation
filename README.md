Loan Prediction Project
This project involves building a Loan Approval Prediction system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a loan should be approved based on applicant details. This project is suitable for beginners looking to learn about classification problems, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

🔍 Problem Statement
The objective is to classify loan applications as Approved or Not Approved using various attributes such as applicant income, education, credit history, and more. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle's Loan Prediction Dataset.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Conclusion & Insights

📁 Dataset Features
Key features used in the dataset include:

Gender, Married, Education, Self_Employed

ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome

LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term

Credit_History, Property_Area

Loan_Status (Target)

✅ Results
The logistic regression model shows decent performance with accuracy around X% (replace with actual value).

Credit history and income are strong predictors of loan approval.
